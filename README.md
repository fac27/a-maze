# a-maze

-   a game where the user has to navigate through a maize to get to the next level
-   the user has to input their name & sprite
-   the game has a count down
-   the user must figure out how to navigate on the keyboard without using arrows
-   the users name, sprite, current score, best score is recorded in local storage (maybe the date as well?)

## MVP

we need:

-   login page with input for name & sprite (emoji)
-   emoji package?
-   aesthetics - retro gaming console on old computer
-   name, emoji & best score on header, counter & current score on footer
-   check if anything is in local storage first to decide whether to render login page or mazepage

As a user I want to be able to create a username and emoji so that I can differentiate myself from others
As a user I want to be able to come back and continue where I left off
As a user I want to feel like I'm back in the 80s and I want to feel like i'm not on a website but playing a game
As a user I want to be able to play the game and get feedback if I can move in a certain direction (ie. if I walk into a wall I can't go through it and get feedback that it's the wrong way)

## stretch

-   heart emoji for life
-   sliding door timeout - to block the user
-   setTimeout for current score

As a user I want obstacles with every level
As a user I want a way to get rewarded for passing multiple levels
As an advane vm user, I want a way to find the cheat sheet
